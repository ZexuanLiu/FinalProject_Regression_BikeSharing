**Final Project Bike Sharing - Regression**

**Abstract**

Bike sharing is one of the popular modes of transportation in many countries. Through bike-sharing systems, users can easily rent bicycles from a location in a city and after user reach their destination, user can return bikes near their destination. However, the bike-sharing rental process is influenced by many factors such as precipitation, day of week, season, hour of the day, etc. Therefore, Therefore, it is very important to understand what factors have the greatest impact on bike sharing. This project uses the bike sharing data recorded by the Capital Bikeshare system in Washington D.C. from 2011 to 2012 as the dataset and uses PyCarentâ€™s Regression feature to analyze the dataset, the count of total rental bikes (cnt) will become the target value. The research results indicate that CatBoostRegression is the best model, and hours are the parameter with the greatest impact on bike sharing.
